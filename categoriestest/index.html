  <li>general&lt;p&gt;When you’re start out at college, many people give you advice (sometimes great; sometimes not so great). This advice often concerns things like use your free time wisely, sit in the front of class, take good notes, don’t stay up too late, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, I’m here to be your 1,000,000 visitor. Because most of this advice is true.</p>

<!--end of excerpt-->

<ul>
  <li>Why did I make a C+ in a class where I should have had at least a B+?
    <ul>
      <li>Didn’t study well enough, sat in back of class, lack of sleep (+ 9 am class).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why did I make a B+ in a class where I should have had an A+?
    <ul>
      <li>Didn’t study well enough, sat in middle of class, didn’t take good notes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why did I make a A+ in a class where I could’ve settled for a B?
    <ul>
      <li>Studied hard, sat in front of class, took good notes, actually studies those notes, was interested in the material.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The last one is a key example. I was interested in the material. Why? I read over the syllabus and found more information (Google is your friend.) about parts of the class that looked cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I struggle to sit and stay attentive when I don’t find the information invigorating. And in school, you will almost always have a class (or several) that you don’t get excited about because they are boring, hard, have a bad teacher, etc. This can usually be overcome by either self-discipline or finding some key part of the class that you are interested in. For me, number 2 works the best.</p>

<p>So, without going too deep into each topic, here are some pieces of advice that I have been using this semester to make better grades.</p>

</ul>

<p>Many of these tips can be used in everyday life. Especially the routines, habits, and techniques you use to make yourself more productive and make it easier to learn things.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Update Aug. 15, 2015: Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u0DZ3fdU6Y">Youtube video</a> of the talk I gave on this topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main idea of Object Oriented Programming is to promote code reuse and handle complexity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-is-an-object">What is an object?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>An object is a representation of something. Some people say it is a representation of concrete things or objects. I like to think that it can be that, and it can also be a representation of an idea. This way you could have objects that represent Cars, Phones, People, and more. But you can also have objects that represent A Graph or a System.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="key-things-to-remember-about-objects">5 key things to remember about objects</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Encapsulation</li>
  <li>Inheritance</li>
  <li>Polymorphism</li>
  <li>Cohesion</li>
  <li>Coupling</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="encapsulation">Encapsulation</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the ability to encapsulate or contain and hide some of the logic in an object. It allows this object to have private attributes/methods and public ones. In Python this is shown in the form of classes. they are Python’s <em>object</em>.  Python’s classes don’t have true encapsulation. But the general consensus is that an underscore in front of a variable or a method denotes it as private.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="inheritence">Inheritence</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inheritance is a little easier to explain. Inheritance happens when you want one object or class to have the properties of another.
Say, for instance, that you have an Animal class. And this Animal class has the property: is_alive = True.
Inheritance comes into play when you want to have a class for Dogs specifically. So your dog class can inherit from the Animal class. It will therefore inherit all of the properties and methods of the Animal class. So your Dog class will have access yo the is_alive method. This can go even further. You can have a property: number_of_legs = 4, and the method speak() { print “Woof!”}. and then you can create a class named Labrador and it would inherit both of those and the is_alive method from the Animal class.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Polymorphism means you can have multiple instances of the same class. So you can have 3 Labrador class objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="cohesion">Cohesion</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cohesion is how well your classes perform their job. Most of the time you will try to design classes to do one job. So you may have a BankAccount class. And it’s job is to be able to withdraw money, deposit money, &amp; see a balance. Good cohesion means it doesn’t have other things such as get_credit_score and customer_name in it. High cohesion is good!</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="coupling">Coupling</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coupling is the opposite of cohesion in that you want low coupling. Coupling is when one class relies on another class too much. It can happen when you have say a BankAccount class and a PrintBankAccount class. The PrintBankAccount class relies way too much on the BankAccount class. To help you might change the BankAccount class’s display_balance method to return a string. Then pass that to a class that takes a string and prints it. That way you can safely reuse either class.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve almost got my work project up and running!</li>
  <li>I’ve worked on perfecting my website (still working on it).</li>
  <li>I’ve done some research into embedded programming (specifically with C and Python).</li>
  <li>I’ve reviewed some basic C++. Turns out I knew more than I realized.</li>
  <li>I’ve started Iron Coder II and am working on my Euchre Hands program.</li>
  <li>I’ve finished refactoring my Simple Rating System program and am ready to finish writing all of my tests and turn it into a webapp.</li>
  <li>I formatted my Raspberry Pi’s SD card and put a fresh copy of NOOBS with Raspbian being the only OS I added. I wanted to add more but forgot to hook up the ethernet cable (will change this in the future). The main reason I continued, was so I could try out installing RetroPie on top of Raspbian. I’ll add a post on the how-to and the results once I’m done.</li>

  <li>After talking to kjaymiller about my private repositories, I decided to open up my Dev repository.</li>
  <li>In opening that repository, I wanted to split out each subdirectory into it’s own repository with all of it’s own history.</li>
  <li>This was easier said than done, but I found a great bit of information on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359424/detach-subdirectory-into-separate-git-repository/17864475#17864475">this Stack Overflow question</a></li>

<p>Today marks the day that is the beginning of Iron Coder II.  This is a code challenge where I will compete against myself and <a href="http://jamalhansen.com">Jamal Hansen</a> to complete a randomized Ruby Quiz in Python.</p>

<p>We have two weeks to complete this; challenge ends 23:59 CT on 8/15/2015.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://github.com/kylegalloway/Euchre-Hands">link to my git repo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jamalhansen/Iron-Coder-II">Jamal’s</a></p>

<p>This should be a fun challenge, I’m looking forward to it.</p>

<p>## The Challenge: Euchre Hands
<a href="http://rubyquiz.com/quiz55.html">The following is extracted from Ruby Quiz # 55</a></p>

<p>Euchre Hands (#55)</p>

<p>The card game of Euchre has an unusual ordering of cards in the hand. This week’s Ruby Quiz is to take a random Euchre hand and sort it.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to know is that Euchre is played with a small deck of cards. Four suits are used Diamonds (d), Clubs (c), Spades (s), and Hearts (h), but each suit has only the cards Nine (9), Ten (T), Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K), and Ace (A). The cards are generally ordered as I just listed them, Nine being the low card and Ace the high card. The exception is the “Bowers”.</p>

<p>When a Euchre hand is started, the first task is to select a Trump suit. How that’s done is not important, just know that one suit is always different from the rest. Trump is the best suit, valued higher than the other three suits (which are basically equal). In the Trump suit, the card order changes.</p>

<p>The first oddity of Trump is that the Jack of the selected suit becomes the Right Bower, the highest ranked Trump card. The second oddity is that the other Jack of the same color (Diamonds and Hearts are red while Clubs and Spades are black) becomes the Left Bower, the second highest Trump card. This card is considered to be of the Trump suit for the rest of the hand. For example, if Spades is selected as Trump, the order of Spades becomes (lowest to highest): 9s, Ts, Qs, Ks, As, Jc, and Js. All other suits run Nine to Ace, save that Clubs will be short a Jack.</p>

<p>The three non-Trump suits are equal, but it is good interface to sort the by suit alternating red, black, red, and black, I think. Especially with a GUI, this makes it easier to understand the hand.</p>

<p>Input (on STDIN) will be a line containing the Trump suit, followed by five lines containing a Euchre hand. For example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Diamonds
Kc
Jh
Kd
Td
Ah</code></pre></div>

<p>Your script should output (to STDOUT) the Trump suit, followed by the cards in sorted order (highest card first):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Diamonds
Jh
Kd
Td
Kc
Ah</code></pre></div>

<p>Here is a script that will feed your program random hands:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1">#!/usr/local/bin/ruby -w</span>

    <span class="c1"># build a Euchre deck</span>

  <li>git&lt;h3 id="why-i-did-it"&gt;Why I did it&lt;/h3&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>I realized, after talking with some friends, that keeping all of my work in a single git directory was becoming a problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I couldn’t share it because I had the directory private.</li>
  <li>I couldn’t seem to keep things as separate as I would have liked.</li>
  <li>I could foresee problems with scalability.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I decided to split each and every subdirectory out into their own git repository. But for this to happen, I wanted to make sure that my git history was kept for each repository.</p>

<p>This meant if folder1 hadn’t been used since last year and folder2 had been used some last year and some this year, both would show that correctly without also having the other’s information.</p>

<!--end of excerpt-->
<p>### How I did it
So, after looking for a long time, I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359424/detach-subdirectory-into-separate-git-repository/17864475#17864475">this answer</a>. Using “The Easy Way” allowed me to have everything I wanted to happen.</p>

<p>After separating them all out, I put them all under a folder named Repos. This allowed me to house them in a simple &amp; clean looking way but still maintain their individuality.</p>

<h3 id="after-i-did-it">After I did it</h3>
<p>I decided a few days later, that I wanted a way to update all of the individual git repos that were under this main “Repos” folder.</p>

<p>Again, after searching a bit, I stumbled across a script to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3497123/run-git-pull-over%20-all-subdirectories#comment46218583_12495234">pull all subdirectories</a>.
It happened to be deep in the comments, but it works fantastically on both OSX and Linux.</p>

  <li>productivity&lt;p&gt;When you’re start out at college, many people give you advice (sometimes great; sometimes not so great). This advice often concerns things like use your free time wisely, sit in the front of class, take good notes, don’t stay up too late, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, I’m here to be your 1,000,000 visitor. Because most of this advice is true.</p>

<!--end of excerpt-->

<ul>
  <li>Why did I make a C+ in a class where I should have had at least a B+?
    <ul>
      <li>Didn’t study well enough, sat in back of class, lack of sleep (+ 9 am class).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why did I make a B+ in a class where I should have had an A+?
    <ul>
      <li>Didn’t study well enough, sat in middle of class, didn’t take good notes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why did I make a A+ in a class where I could’ve settled for a B?
    <ul>
      <li>Studied hard, sat in front of class, took good notes, actually studies those notes, was interested in the material.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The last one is a key example. I was interested in the material. Why? I read over the syllabus and found more information (Google is your friend.) about parts of the class that looked cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I struggle to sit and stay attentive when I don’t find the information invigorating. And in school, you will almost always have a class (or several) that you don’t get excited about because they are boring, hard, have a bad teacher, etc. This can usually be overcome by either self-discipline or finding some key part of the class that you are interested in. For me, number 2 works the best.</p>

<p>So, without going too deep into each topic, here are some pieces of advice that I have been using this semester to make better grades.</p>
