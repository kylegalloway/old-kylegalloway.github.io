###(August 16, 2015 - August 22, 2015)

This week, I started a new semester of school.

<!--end of excerpt-->

### Some things I've done
* Learned how to write some [small programs](https://github.com/kylegalloway/cs503) in [Scheme](http://www.schemers.org/).
* Open-Sourced my [personal goals](https://github.com/kylegalloway/personal-goals) per [this blog](http://una.im/personal-goals-guide/#💁).
* Talked to the head of the graduate school about a program that would allow me to take classes that count for both my bachelor's and master's degrees.
* Submitted an application for that program.
* Talked to one of my favorite professors about a possible upcoming research opportunity.
* Looked into [Floating-Point Arithemetic](http://floating-point-gui.de/).

### Looking ahead
* Hopefully, I will know about both my application and the research opportunity next week.
* I plan to write many more scheme programs to practice for an upcoming test.
* High School football season is here!! I will go watch my brother-in-law play tonight and my brother tomorrow night.
