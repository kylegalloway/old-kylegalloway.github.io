###(August 31, 2015 - September 6, 2015)

This week, I took my first test and started working on my research project.

<!--end of excerpt-->

### Some things I've done
* Write a second (content) blog post for the first time in almost a month.
* Prepared for and took my first test this semester. It wasn't as bad as it could've been.
* Continued learning about topics that relate to my research with Dr. Anderson.
* Got declined for the scholarship I was looking into, but I'm still looking at other funding sources.

### Looking ahead
* Next week I have another test (different class).
* I need to start writing some for my projects in some classes.
* I'll probably be really busy again.

### Media
* Movies
    * [The Princess Bride](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/)
    * [Casablanca](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

> With those two, you should have all the quotes you need.
