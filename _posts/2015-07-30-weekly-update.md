Hey guys, I hope you'll understand if I'm taking a hiatus from my blog writing.
I'm in the middle of a very rough semester of school, I'm quiting my job to start researching, and I'm trying to spend time each day to get in shape. (At 5'6"-5'7", weighing 225 lbs is unacceptable. I'm aiming for 165-170 lbs.)

I'll still try to remember to write something every once in awhile but I won't have weekly updates and probably won't be very regular in my posting.

Wish me luck!
