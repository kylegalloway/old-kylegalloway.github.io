# Weekly Update (July 26, 2015 - Aug. 1, 2015)

Phew! I've been writing a huge amount of python this week.

### Some things I've done (Python)
* Worked through the first 6 chapters of [The Goat Book](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754/index.html)
* Worked on my Simple Rating System. (Hopefully I can turn it into a web app soon)
* Looked through and thoroughly learned the ins and outs of the [Python Thursday Adventure Game](https://github.com/code-newbies/python-thursday-adventure)
* Researched differences in Flask and Django. I like Flask but that's because I'm partial to minimal setups and micro-frameworks.
* Found tons of books and resources on OOP, TDD, Algorithms, Good Practices, and a variety of other things in Python.

### Other Highlights
* After talking to kjaymiller about my private repositories, I decided to open up my Dev repository.
* In opening that repository, I wanted to split out each subdirectory into it's own repository with all of it's own history.
* This was easier said than done, but I found a great bit of information on [this Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359424/detach-subdirectory-into-separate-git-repository/17864475#17864475)
* I also found a [nifty little bash script (see comment by Zarat on the accepted answer from Mar. 11 at 11:06)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3497123/run-git-pull-over-all-subdirectories) to enable me to put all of my git repositories in one directory and pull them all at the same time.
* My routines are starting to become habits thanks to [HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com) soon to be [Habitica](https://habitica.com)
* I've settled on [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) as my podcast app and plan to buy the pro version soon.
* Speaking of podcasts, here's my current list:
    * Always Listen

* I've fixed my iPhones home-screen to be one row of 4 folders, 3 rows of apps and the home row (4 apps) after listening to Cortex.
* I've started to really improve my French learning. The combination of Memrise, Duolingo, and trying to speak it as much as possible have helped.


That's all for now. I'll update this post if anything happens between today and Saturday.

### Always Obey the Testing Goat!
