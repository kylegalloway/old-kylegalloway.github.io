###(August 23, 2015 - August 31, 2015)

This week, I worked hard to stay on top of school.

<!--end of excerpt-->
### Some things I've done
* Got into grad school! I'm now taking 4 grad level classes that count for both grad and undergrad degrees.
* Got started on some research with my first meeting.
* Worked through exercise 31 in [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/).
* Wrote several new (to me at least) [functions in Scheme](https://github.com/kylegalloway/CS503).

### Looking ahead
* Prepare for my first test in CS 575.
* Try really, really hard to write a content (non-update) blog piece.
* Keep pushing ahead in [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/).
* Learn about all of the cool technologies related to my research.
