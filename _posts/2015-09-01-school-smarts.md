When you're start to go to college, many people give you some great advice (sometimes too much; sometimes not so great). This advice often concerns things like use your free time wisely, sit in the front of class, take good notes, don't stay up too late, etc.

Well, I'm here to be your 1,000,000 advisor. Because most of this advice is true.

- Why did I make a C+ in a class where I should have had at least a B+? Didn't study well enough, sat in back of class, lack of sleep (+ 9 am class).
- Why did I make a B+ in a class where I should have had an A+? Didn't study well enough, sat in middle of class, didn't take good notes.
- Why did I make a A+ in a class where I could've settled for a B? Studied hard, sat in front of class, took good notes, actually studies those notes, was interested in the material.

The last one is a key example, I was interested in the material, why? I read over the syllabus and found more information (qoogle!) about parts of the class that looked cool. I struggle to sit and stay attentive when I don't find the information invigorating. And in school, you will almost always have a class (or several) that you don't get excited about because they are boring, hard, have a bad teacher, etc. This can usually be overcome by either self-discipline or finding some key part of the class that you are interested in. For me, number 2 works the best.

So, without going too deep into each topic, here are some pieces of advise that I have been using this semester to make better grades.
