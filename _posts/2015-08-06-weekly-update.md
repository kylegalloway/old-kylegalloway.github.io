###(Aug. 2, 2015 - Aug. 8, 2015)

This week, I fought the no motivation bug

### Some things I've done
* I've almost got my work project up and running!
* I've worked on perfecting my website (still working on it).
* I've done some research into embedded programming (specifically with C and Python).
* I've reviewed some basic C++. Turns out I knew more than I realized.
* I've started Iron Coder II and am working on my Euchre Hands program.
* I've finished refactoring my Simple Rating System program and am ready to finish writing all of my tests and turn it into a webapp.
* I formatted my Raspberry Pi's SD card and put a fresh copy of NOOBS with Raspbian being the only OS I added. I wanted to add more but forgot to hook up the ethernet cable (will change this in the future). The main reason I continued, was so I could try out installing RetroPie on top of Raspbian. I'll add a post on the how-to and the results once I'm done.
