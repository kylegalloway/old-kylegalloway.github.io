###(Aug. 9, 2015 - Aug. 15, 2015)

This week, I was super busy. Or at least felt that I was.

### Some things I've done
* I've gotten my work project up and running! It took some help but I got it rolling!
* I've finished [Iron Coder II](http://kylegalloway.me/python/2015/08/01/iron-coder-ii/). My final code is [here](https://github.com/kylegalloway/Euchre-Hands).
* I've been working really hard in [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/). It's more challenging than I thought, but very much worth it.

### Looking ahead
* I want to look into data visualization with Python. There is some really cool stuff that can be done with it. Like [this](http://maxberggren.github.io/2015/08/04/basemap/).
* I also want to look into Machine Learning (again with Python). It seems to be where the future of computing lies.
