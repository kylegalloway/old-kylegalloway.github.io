# Testing

Testing is hard.

It doesn't matter what language you are using or what you are testing. Testing is hard. But testing and finding ways to pass tests is a huge improvement over writing code, then debugging. This doesn't mean you won't have to debug your code when testing, but it means most of your problems will be solved before you get to that step.
